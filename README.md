# Dataet:
Data Professional Survey Data

# Operations Performed:
In this project, I created a dashboard using Microsoft PowerBI with survey data from data professionals. The dashboard includes a treemap showing the nationality of respondents, a stacked bar chart for average salary, a stacked column chart for preferred programming languages, a donut chart illustrating the difficulty of breaking into the field, and a gauge displaying satisfaction with salary and work/life balance.
